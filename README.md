# TextManip
TextManip is a Beginner django project with various implementations of string manipulations.

This is a project is made as an ice-breaking project to grasp the very basic concepts of django.

TextManip does basic manipulations to text like:
->Remove punctuations
->Remove extra spaces
->Remove redundant new lines

I have also used Bootstrap to make the interface beautiful & responsive.
